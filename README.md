This is the English version of this book. If you are a Chinese reader, please check [this page](https://item.jd.com/12666058.html). Our code is in github: [code](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook2).

From 2019.6 the English version has been changed to LaTeX instead of markdown. In this repo you can find the LaTeX source files, and if you are only interested in the compiled pdf, click [here](./slambook-en.pdf).

I've finished the translation work in 2021.2.28. Thanks for all the patience.

## For reviewers and collaborators
- Please refer to chapter-cn directory for Chinese version. 
- If you want to compile the cn version, install the fonts in font/ directory first, and use xelatex to compile. There might be some warnings or errors but you will see a compiled pdf to compare the results between the translated version and the original.
